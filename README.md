## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset** to evaluate sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, product category dynamics, logistics efficiency, customer satisfaction, and seller ecosystem health.

The project covers a complete, end-to-end **Data Analytics Workflow**—starting from raw data quality validation and SQL querying in **PostgreSQL** to analytical data modeling and interactive dashboard development in **Power BI**.

The main objective is to transform raw e-commerce data into actionable, data-driven business insights that support strategic decision-making across sales, marketing, logistics, product management, and seller operations.

## 📁 Dataset Architecture

The project utilizes the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset** sourced from Kaggle. 

The dataset contains approximately **100,000 anonymized orders** placed on the marketplace between 2016 and 2018 across Brazil. It consists of **9 relational tables**:

* `customers`
* `geolocation`
* `order_items`
* `order_payments`
* `order_reviews`
* `orders`
* `products`
* `sellers`
* `product_category_name_translation`

> **Note:** Raw CSV datasets are not stored directly in this repository to keep the repository lightweight. You can download the official dataset directly from [Kaggle — Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## 📐 Data Modeling (Star Schema)

Rather than directly importing 9 unoptimized relational tables into Power BI, an **analytical Star Schema** was designed. Data was pre-aggregated and structured using dedicated SQL views (`08_create_star_schema_views.sql`) to optimize reporting performance and measure calculations.

* **`vw_fact_sales`**: Central transactional fact table containing order items, item prices, freight costs, payment values, delivery performance metrics, and review scores.
* **`vw_dim_customers`**: Customer attributes, unique IDs, and geographic locations (city, state).
* **`vw_dim_products`**: Product IDs, translated product categories, and physical measurements.
* **`vw_dim_sellers`**: Seller IDs, locations, and historical performance tiers.
* **`vw_dim_date`**: Comprehensive calendar table enabling seamless time-intelligence DAX calculations.

## 💡 Key Business Insights

### 1. Severe Revenue Concentration in Primary States
* **São Paulo (SP)** alone accounts for approximately **38%** of total platform revenue.
* The top 3 states (**São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais**) collectively generate roughly **63%** of overall revenue.
* **Business Implication**: Olist's revenue streams are heavily reliant on Southeastern Brazil, leaving the platform vulnerable to regional market shifts or localized supply chain bottlenecks.

### 2. Critically Low Customer Retention
* The overall customer repeat purchase rate is approximately **3%**.
* Over **97%** of customers complete only a single transaction on the platform.
* **Business Implication**: Platform growth is overwhelmingly driven by continuous acquisition of new users rather than customer retention, indicating an opportunity to increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

### 3. Direct Link Between Delivery Delays and Customer Satisfaction
* **On-Time Deliveries**: Average Review Score = **4.29 / 5.00**
* **Late Deliveries**: Average Review Score = **2.57 / 5.00**
* **Insight**: Delays cause a sharp drop of **1.72 rating points**, making delivery punctuality one of the single largest drivers of customer review scores.

### 4. Seller Supply Growth Outpaces Order Volume
* The count of active sellers grew significantly throughout 2018, but total order volume did not scale at a matching rate.
* **Insight**: Average **orders per active seller declined**, pointing to heightened intra-marketplace competition and potential seller revenue dilution.

### 5. Extreme Seller Geographic Bottleneck
* Approximately **60% of all registered sellers** operate from the state of **São Paulo (SP)**.
* **Business Implication**: This heavy seller concentration increases long-distance shipping lead times and freight costs when fulfilling orders to Northern and Northeastern regions.

## 🎯 Strategic Business Recommendations

1. **Improve Delivery Performance & Logistics Optimization**
   * Prioritize logistical infrastructure and regional carrier partnerships in states with high late-delivery rates (e.g., Alagoas, Maranhão).
   * Establish late-delivery rate as a primary operational KPI for supply chain teams.

2. **Increase Customer Retention & Lifetime Value**
   * Launch automated post-purchase marketing campaigns and loyalty incentives to encourage repeat purchases within 30–60 days.
   * Introduce purchase subscriptions or automated re-order reminders for high-frequency consumable categories.

3. **Expand Regional Seller Coverage Outside Major Hubs**
   * Actively recruit and onboard sellers in Northern, Northeastern, and Southern states to shorten regional fulfillment distances.
   * Target regions displaying high customer demand but low local seller representation.

4. **Monitor and Maintain Seller Productivity**
   * Track "Orders per Active Seller" as a standard marketplace health metric.
   * Balance seller recruitment with demand generation to protect average seller profitability and reduce seller churn.

5. **Reduce Geographic Concentration Risk**
   * Run targeted marketing campaigns to increase customer penetration beyond SP, RJ, and MG.
   * Offer regional freight subsidies to incentivize cross-state purchasing.
